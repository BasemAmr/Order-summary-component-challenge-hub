## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SVG for Wavy Background
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned a lot about SVG in HTML, I don't know if anyone will believe me, but I really didn't notice the SVG background attached but after I spent 2 hours searching how to make a wavy background.
I drew the SVG background myself.
The challenge was also [challenging] for me to apply the plan small box inside the card, because it was a little tricky to use CSS Grid there.

### Continued development

While searching on SVG, I saw many mind blowing examples of it, it seems to be very powerful.
I will search more about it and learn how to make these "ultra magnific" animations.

### Useful resources

- [MDN: SVG Path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths) - This really helped me in creating the background, very detailed with examples.
